TODO List:
----------

Message Browser:
- add the possibility to add columns in viewer with user defined JMS properties

Messages:
- Stop to consider the "priority" and "delivery mode" attributes as mandatory attributes. 
- Object Messages:the current implementation does not allow to save an object message as a template
  -> this because the implementation class may only be defined at the plugin level not at the core and this is the core that handle templates
  -> a solution is to allow to add jars to the core plugin (how?) with object message class implmentation

SoapUI:
- finish the development of the SoapUI plugin to interact with JTB (What specs?)

     
Ideas for new Features:
-----------------------
Editors:
- Replace Payload JFace Text component by an xml editor based on "org.eclipse.jface.text.source.SourceViewer"
- Use a combo box (or buttons) to switch between various text formating (raw, xml, json etc.)

Variables:
- Manage multiple instances of a variable: ${var:instance}

Code/General:
- I18N: What languages (french + ?)
