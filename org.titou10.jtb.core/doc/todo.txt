TODO List:
----------

UI:
- Add a "delete" icon/button in every list

Message Browser:
- add the possibility to add columns in viewer with user defined JMS properties

REST:
- Continue to expose JTB features as REST services:
  - Script execution (Needs a script engine refactoring...)

Messages:
- ? D&D of multiple messages to template -> How to generate names
- Stop to consider the "priority" and "delivery mode" attributes as mandatory attributes. 
- Object Messages:the current implementation does not allow to save an object message as a template
  -> this is because the implementation class may on;y be dfined at the plugin level not at the core and this is the core that handle templates
  -> a solution is to allow to add jars to the core plugin (how?) with object message class implmentation

SoapUI:
- finish the development of the SoapUI plugin to interact with JTB (What specs?)

     
Ideas for new Features:
-----------------------
Messages browser:
- Add the possibility for the user to manage columns based on JMS or user properties

Queues:
- Manage "Alias" queues and/Or queues that can not be browsed (like in IBm MQ) and do not open the browser view when a message is posted to those queueus
  -> requires a major refactoring to the QManager interface to bring up that infomation to the core plugin
 
Editors:
- Replace Payload JFace Text component by an xml editor based on "org.eclipse.jface.text.source.SourceViewer"
- Use a combo box (or buttons) for various formatiing (raw, xml, json etc.)

Variables:
- Manage multiple instances of a variable: ${var:instance}

Templates:
- rewrite template import (add "replace" options, select destination template subdir etc..)

Code/General:
- I18N: What languages (french + ?)
- Reduce TODOs
